* My goal is to study the front-end profession and become a programmer.
Learn how to make up websites and computer programs. Up to this point, I was making up primitive-looking landing pages.
Independently studied basic knowledge of Html, CSS and Javascript. With the help of the entry level in Rscool, I learned the basic knowledge of Git.*
